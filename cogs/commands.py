So when investing in stocks or other types of investments it is important to look at EVERYTHING. This includes how the company is doing, public opinion, and the charts. Nerdwallet explains stock price as such, “That supply and demand help determine the price for each security, or the levels at which stock market participants — investors and traders — are willing to buy or sell.” And they also mention how buying and selling works, “Buyers offer a “bid,” or the highest amount they’re willing to pay, which is usually lower than the amount sellers “ask” for in exchange. This difference is called the bid-ask spread. For a trade to occur, a buyer needs to increase his price or a seller needs to decrease hers.” [More Info Here... :smile:](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp)')

These companies will usually payout every month, quarter, semi-annually, or yearly. • Cyclical Stock - These are stocks who will have ups and downs based on the economy and are more sensitive when there is an economic downturn. •Blue Chip Stocks -  Very safe stocks usually from big companies with large market caps. These companies will usually be a well known name like Walmart, Apple, or Coca Cola. These companies are more than likely to be financially sound and survive economic crashes. • Tech Stocks - Companies based around technology. These usually have the most growth but also come with an associated risk. Technology advances fast meaning if the company does not keep up it can fall out of favor. • Speculative Stocks - Usually extreme risk, these are companies that are new and usually don’t have much history or financial stability. These companies can bring immense profits as well as risk. • Defensive Stocks - Stocks that are extremely safe, these companies have been around for centuries sometimes and are impossible to stop. These stocks will do good and recover from crashes and sometimes even profit. Examples are prominent in the consumer staples sector, an example is Walmart. • Growth Stocks - Most do not pay out dividends as they would rather keep that money and reinvest it into their company for more growth. These stocks will bring good growth and profit is only made on capital gains. [More Info Here... :smile:](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp)')

Without a broker you cannot trade, when you decide to buy a stock it is sent to the broker (this used to be a real person on the floors of the NYSE, now it is all automatic), they will buy it for you and be the middleman. ✦ Can you invest in the stock market under the age of 18? - Yes, you can invest in the stock market under the age of 18, but only with the permission and having a parent signed on with you. In the UK you will need to open what is called a junior stocks and shares ISA, in the US you need what is called a custodial account. Both of these are accounts that belong to your parents until you are 18 and then owner ship is transferred to you, this will allow you to access the stock market and invest. You can find these by looking it up on google or going to your bank, as they will most likely help you set one up or recommend one. ✦ What are some good and trust worthy brokerage accounts? - Brokerages will depend on your location for the EU, typically Trading 212, Interactive Brokers, and EToro are used. For the US brokers like Webull, Robinhood (which is not a good choice as it is being investigated by the SEC, is very unreliable, and has a 10 million dollar lawsuit), Charles Schwab, E*TRADE, Think Or Swim, TD Ameritrade, are all great brokers. When choosing your broker it is a good idea to look at them all to see which one applies to what you are looking for. ✦ What is paper trading? - Paper trading is the act of trading with simulated money, this is most commonly used for practice. Investopedia says the following, "A paper trade is a simulated trade that allows an investor to practice buying and selling without risking real money."

ETFs on the other hand have another system as defined by Investopedia, " ETFs have a unique process called creation/redemption in-kind (meaning shares of ETFs can be created and redeemed with a like basket of securities) that avoids these transaction costs." Index Funds also have the cost of cash drag, which  ETFs do not have to deal with. However an advantage that Index Funds have over ETFs is when it comes to dividends. Index Funds will immediately reinvest their dividends compared to ETFs which pool them up and pay them out at the end of each quarter. ETFs also have lower management fees. However the biggest cost in ETFs is the shareholder transaction cost, which is usually 0 for Index Funds. \n[Index Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) \n[ETF](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp)')
